# disjack
DISJACK - Discord DLL Hijacking and Proxying POC.

i mean this is basically worthless fr,
could be made /a lot/ better.
but still worthless...
glorified debug environment whitin discord memory spacez


## Issues       
1. The code is executed more than once on launch.
2. A Discord update would kill persistence, there has to be a workaround.
